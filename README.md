## Summary 
#### Based on my analysis as can be seen above, the percentage of unpaid 5 star reviews is 51.5% while the percentage of paid 5 star reviews is 47.6%. These two values are very similar with the percentage of paid 5 star reviews being slightly lower by almost 4 percent. Since there is such a small sample of paid reviews, there is not enough data to support that people are more inclined to give a product 5 stars because they were being paid. However, based on the sample size for the unpaid reviews we can conclude that about half of those who reviewed the products did rate them 5 stars without a bias. An additional analysis that we can do is create a box table to see how close the data is to the median. We can then compare the box plots of unpaid vs paid reviews and see how they compare. Another analysis we can do is to look at the percentage of  1 star reviews, 2 star reviews, and 3 start reviews and see how that compares from paid and upaid reviews. Are paid reviews more likely to score higher even if its not a 5 star reivew?
